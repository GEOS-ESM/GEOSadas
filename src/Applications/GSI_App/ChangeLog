05Jan2021
---------
- Change to allow use of South Pole Raob (read_prepbufr)
- Change to handle SatWind updates from EUMETSAT (read_obs.F90 and read_satwnd.f90)
- Update gmao_global_satinfo.rc: new handle of CrIS-FSR (N20 and NPP), ocean only; only used data participate in cloud screaning
- Trigger for decimal-like qc flag: gsi.rc.tmpl, gsi_sens.rc.tmpl, obs1gsi_mean.rc and obs1gsi_member.rc
- Turn on CrIS-FSR Ozone-sensitive channels
- Update RCOV files for CrIS-FSR (handling O3 sensitive channels), RC file: gmao_global_anavinfo_rcov
- Revise CrIS-FSR info in gmao_global_tlapmean.rc 

Note: changes in gsi.rc (and similar files) to trigger use of decimal QC flag
      also affect handling of O3 sensitive channels in the AIRS and IASI
      instruments (these were not being handled correctly before)

14Oct2020
---------
- g5pert: take into consideration eps_eer when converting pert to energy and when calculating total 
          energy - this has been wrong for a while (fixed for M2 obsimp)
- add tarball in ensemble for saving cubed trajectory (background) files for JEDI
- central DAS can store traj_lcv_rst files in own tar ball (for JEDI)
- updates from GEOSadas-5_27_0_DryMass: zero diff to default (LLT)
- add sigO to xvec slot of AOD output ODS files (required for DFS)
- agcm_import files (IAU increment) now truly nc4 (little mistake before had changed filename sfx but not content)
- add COSMIC-2; obsys-nccs includes period of concatenated GPSRO files before
  NCEP had COSMIC-2 in the official stream
- add back treatment of channel-correlated CrIS-FSR for both NPP and NOAA-20 (Wei)
- adjustment to MHS QC for allsky (MJK)
- revise automatic forecasts when forecast sensitivities are requested; now
  creating 24 and 30 hour sensitivities automatically.
- fully automated launching of FSOI jobs
- when 4d, store IAU increments in agcmrst tarball

- JEDI Support:
  o knob to run JEDI analysis following GSI and optionally overwrite IAU
    increments with those generated from JEDI analysis (i.e., cycle from JEDI analysis)

16Aug2020
---------
- Back out CrIS-FSR NPP; revised CrIS-FSR revised channels; CrIS-FSR chn correlations

21Jul2020
---------
- checked and unified all analysis-related ozone const converting from ppmv2gg
  (including GSI constoz)
- another opt in GSI to control its ozone berror (set to current choice) 
- >>> Backout upgrade to background errors <<<

26Jun2020
---------
- Further updates to Bkgecov software - now generate all BClim
- Hermes updates to support latest bkgecov
- update new Bclim 26Jun2020 (note: D resolution points to x0041rt)
- Updates to bring CrIS FSR
- Updates to allow alternative GPSRO bending angle profile integration
- Ensemble now supports OSE-type capability - only 3dvar type for now; AOD ana to be done

15Jun2020
---------
- update NCEP_bkgecov to: rt-NCEP_bkgecov-5_17_AllSky-4-FromPerts
  this implementes considerable changes to the original code, in particular
  i) Clim statistics can now be generated directly from NMC perturbations; and
  (ii) a code that took over 7 hour to process a year of statistics now works 
  in less than 25 min.

- change of BKGECOV code is require HERMES update:rt-GMAO_hermes-5_26-addRH-4bkgecov
  this allows appending RH differences and mean RH to files create by dyndiff;
  these in turn serve to create NMC-like perturbations.

10May2020
--------
Revised background error statistics:
 o  Use of Bclim calculated on the basis of f522 fcsts;
 o  Mildly revised Bclim weights to adjust to f522;
 o  Use of f522 NMC-like perts for ensemble inflation;
 o  Mildly revised inflation coeffs to adjust to f522.

- Corrected mistake of not accounting for hydrometeors in dry mass constraint

- GSI includes a number of changes in hybrid component, but all are 
  zero-diff to previous version unless options are invoked by desire:
    o anavinfo allows for scaling of ensemble spreads (beyong hybens_loc_info)
    o ensemble covariance can be form from mean other thant ensemble mean 
    o ensemble covariance can be updated along with outer minimization

25Feb2020

    - AtmEnsConfig.csh
- add O3 sensitive IR channels to analysis (Rcov updated accordingly)
  Note: ensemble observer intentionally does not use these o3-sens IR channels
- considerable reduction in count of some AMV due to changes in thinning (might need revision)

22Jan2020
---------
- GSI merge w/ NCEP, tag: jg-gsi-rt-GEOSadas-5_26_TEMP1_p1
- back to using 2-Loops for FSOI (adjoint GSI);
  remember to remove USRMITER env flag from OPS script
- enable MHS all-sky; base tag: "mkim-gsi-rt-GEOSadas-5_26_TEMP1_allskyMHSadded"
                      also tag: "meta_MetOpC_AMSUA_MHS"

  extension of the names from .bin to .nc4; from the second cycle on 
  all ensemble GCM RST files will be nc4
- more flexible setup
- setup for C360 ensemble
- dual resolution ensemble DA (for C360)
- GSI updated w/ GSIrefactOO+3obOpers_2m1-8

  and: jjin_GEOSadas-5_25_0_RadOz_thinning_p1
- Add subclasses to kx=242,250,252 in convinfo.rc 
- Avoidance of ATMS QC check in setuprad (in GMAO version vs NCEP) after gross check
- Bug fix in handling of PS ensemble spread (related to staticB variable)

11Dec2018
---------
- Update from Ben Auer in support of split cap;
  original tag: bma_GEOSadas-5_22_0_p2_splitcap

03Dec2018
---------
- Enable SPPT in EnsDA; merge w/ tag: Amal-GEOSadas-5_22_0_p1-stoch-phys-1  
- Optional kx split for Ship obs:
     tag: SA-id_ships_convinfo-MetaS_reviewed-GEOSadas-5_22_0_p1

08Oct2018: EnADAS-5_22_0p1
----------
- Add full knob for correlated obs (see fvsetup and
  gmao_global_anavinfo_rcov.txt/rc); note split in anavinfo
  zero-diff to 5_22_0 when correlated obs not triggered.

24Sep2018: EnADAS-5_22_0
----------
- partial merge with NCEP All-Sky implementation
   5_21_3_p1 and VLab-ProdGSI-master-2018062220Z1707-60d4448
- increased paoverbpb for EnKF from 0.975 to 0.990 - this gets descent amount
  of radiance in both C90 and C180 configurations

14Aug2018: EnADAS-5_21_5
---------
- Update to bma_ADAS_MAPLRefactor_5_21_2 which include latest changes in MAPL
  (including adding pFIO) - this version does not reproduce its predecessor
  but results are almost roundoff. Furthermore, at present tag steps back
  from reading the ensemble members in parallel in GSI due to a bug in pFIO
  still to be uncovered.

26Jul2018:
---------
- Add ability to handle OMPs (merge w/ Wargan: kw-GEOSadas-5_21_2-OMPS-all3)
- Additional norms for initadj and related programs

---------
- rid RC files of ak/bk info; using set_eta instead
  modules changes: -> GSI, MKIAU, GEOSgcmPert

16Apr2018:
---------
- Support for YZhu sat-bias-correction in both central and EnADAS (Ticket #3)
- Add GMAObufr_util under Applications/GMAO_Etc to support gen of GMAO version
  of AVHRR files not provided by NCEP (Ticket #39) 
- note new RC file in run/atmens: 
     o dyn_recenter.rc - controls recentering parameters (for now set to
                         behave as usual)
- Note on RSTs for GEOSadas-5_20_x:
    - when coming from f519_fpp users only need to BOOTSTRAP moist_import_rst
      which means deleting the files coming from f519_fpp in both central and
      EnADAS; both should use AGCM.BOOTSTRAP.rc.tmpl both recall that ensemble
      use old-style bootstrap, which requires copying AGCM.rc.tmpl into
      BOOTSTRAP file and commenting out line for MOIST_IMPORT_RESTART_FILE 
    - when RSTs are from any other version (say, f517_fp) full BOOTSTRAP
      should take place.

09Jan2017:
---------
Changes from Meta (GOES-16 and Revised convinfo file):

19Dec2016: Updates to EnADAS-5_16_4
=========
  Tag:     EnADAS-5_16_4p2
  Module:  GEOSadas-5_16
  GCM:     Heracles-5_4_p3 (changes to AGCM_gridComp and Phys_GridComp)
  GSI:     EnADAS-5_16_4p2

- MAPL corrections to allow properly running cube-to-cube interpolation
- MAPL corrections to allow producing backward (PERT) output via History
- Reset RAIN_REVAP_FAC: 1.0 in both central and ensemble (AGCM.rc.tmpl)
- Correction to handling reduced GSI diag files output produced in the
  ensemble observers. The fixes here involve updates to ODS, and the ensemble
    scripts that handle ODS generation.
    - Fix in satellite DB handling AMSUA-AQUA: channel 14 bias correction
    turned
      off, since no longer assimilated
      - Turned off AURA channel 8

29Nov2016: EnADAS-5_16_4
- Merge with Heracles-5_4_p3

29Nov2016: EnADAS-5_16_3p3
- rename hyb localization files to reflect horiz-res dependency
- allow cycle to store flow-dependent variances
- fix for MLS55 ozone in EnKF
- allow ensemble observers to handle observations related to diurnal variations in SST
- minor changes to GAAS analysis to allow running observer over post-ana ODS files
- Use of Heracles-5_4_p2
- Fix use of DFI coeffs in AGCMGridComp (thus far not used in cycle)
01Oct2016: EnADAS-5_6_1
- Lowered transition zone for beta weights
- mkiau, GEOS_Agcm, and inc-part of GEOSmkiau all changed
  following Larry's change to used DELP in place of PS to
  calculate IAU increment.

21Jun2016
- Merge with Heracles-5_2_p1
  Not all GCM files are the same. The following are 
  changed from the GCM tag:
  GEOSagcm_GridComp/GEOS_AgcmGridComp.F90
  GEOSagcm_GridComp/GEOSphysics_GridComp/GEOSsurface_GridComp/GEOSland_GridComp/GEOScatch_GridComp/mk_restarts/mk_Restarts
  GEOSmkiau_GridComp/DynVec_GridComp.F90
  GEOSmkiau_GridComp/GEOS_mkiauGridComp.F90
 These are largely related to the implementation of 4dIAU
    
- Update CO2 used in GSI: now taking it from cbkg.eta file
  This means: users must update CO2 in their gocart restart files by running
  the following command line (gogo.x in FVROOT/bin):
  gogo.x -s Chem_Registry.rc -t Chem_Registry.rc -i USER.gocart_internal_rst.yyyymmdd_hhz.bin -o new.bin -c 40e-6 -r RESOLUTION -l 72
  where resolution is something like c360, or c90, etc (see gogo.x command line info)

  NOTES: 
     1 - Users running ensemble ADAS must do the same for each membe of the ensemble
     2 - Make sure Chem_Registry.rc is consistent w/ gocart RSTs being used
     3 - The first cycle of the DAS will take slightly less radiance than usual simply 
         because the cbkg.eta file will likely have old CO2 levels; unless cbkg has been 
	 corrected some other way. This will correct itself as the DAS cycles.

- Add knobs to relocate and track vortex in ensemble DAS

23Mar2016
- update GSI to merge with ncep-gsi-r68292
  (this involves considerable updates to the convinfo file - considerable
  changes in the wind selection and QC).

22Mar2016
- update EnKF with initial implementation of aerosol capability

18Mar2016
- back to 24Jun2011 background error covariance (Amal still tunning coming update)
- using sfcio to read fix ncep-sfc file w/ vegtype and all
- update CRTM to: ncep-crtm-REL-2_2_3-r60152_gmao-build 

29Feb2016
- permanently add QR/QS to GSI background
  NOTE: This requires RST updates for members and central DAS
  users activating MERRA-2 settings will need to be careful
- GSI merge w/ NCEP-r65747

21Oct2015

- NST analysis (new defaults)
  o GSI settings uses NST analysis
  o IAU constructs DTSDT increment
  o model has diurnal layer on and takes in DTSDT increment
- GSI now uses GMAO-maintained prepob error table 
  (errors set to be consistent w/ MERRA)

20Sep2015
---------
- brough in Wei's and Jing's work on correlated obs and full-res observer,
respectively:
   rt-gsi-5137p3-JGuoObvsr2 original tag: jg-gsi-EnADAS-5_13_4p3_obs-redistr-r2
   rt-gsi-5137p3-WeiCorrObs original tag: wgu-GSIsa_m3-pert-04Oct14-BBC_bundle-2_BR_01

In default configuration these changes are zero diff to the GSI in EnADAS-5_13_7p3

22Apr2014
---------
- Merge with Jinang Jun's gmi/tmi bug fix:
  jjin_EnADAS-5_13_7_tmi_gmi_qcbug_fix
- Merge with Min-Jeong's QC updates: mkim-EnADAS-5_13_6-iextraQC
  including de-activation of HIRS chns 7-11
- Merge with Wei Gu's tag: wgu-GSIsa_m3-pert-04Oct14-BBC_bundle-2
  adjustments to interchannel observation error correlations software 
  (still off)
- Revisit (tightened) RAOB observation errors (prepobs_errtable.global)
  consequently GSI now reads prepobs_errtable and bypasses errors in prepbufr file

01Dec2014
---------
Tag name: GSIsa_m3-pert-01Dec14_merge-r47948
GSI has been updated and is now merged with changes from NCEP as of their
last trunk update in November 2014 (r47948). Specifically, local changes
include:
a) revamped background bias correction mechanism (GMAO)
b) clean up version of GMI/TMI (GMAO)
c) cosmetic loop-level optimization (NCEP)
d) Revisted dot-product (an attempt to reproducibility across PEs; NCEP)
e) near-generalization to hybrid component to allow more flexible 
   specification of ensemble covariance (GMAO)


03Jun2014
---------
- Fully merged with NCEP's trunk as of end of May2014.
- Bring in GMI/TMI (beyond NCEP trunk) from Jianjin Jin
- Add all main sensors of Metop-b (per x0012_metb) as default
- Add SSMI/S (per x0012_metb) as default
- Add CrIS (per x0012_cs) as default
- Use of GPS up to 60km with down-weighted AMSUA-chn14 (per x0014_so14)

28Feb2014
---------
- Sync w/ NCEP trunk (merged version: r36859)

29Sep2013
---------
- automatic determination of observing system for GSI; this is how it works:
   o User chooses OBSCLASS as usual (either thru fvsetup or by hand) in main
     script
   o assuming to proper entry (corresponding to the obs class in question) 
     exists in gsi.rc.tmpl (and gsi_sens.rc.tmpl), the GSI will match the 
     naming it uses with the actual filename obtained from the acquire_obs
     by looking at obsys.rc. For example, the env var OBSCLASS requests the 
     the class ncep_prep_bufr. A call

           append_gsigcrc.pl obsys.rc GSI_GridComp.rc

     to the program append_gsigcrc.pl will look into obsys.rc, figure out
     that the ncep_prep_bufr class brings in file with template name
               gdas1.%y4%m2%d2.t%h2z.prepbufr.ublk 
     and  append the class and the filename template to GSI_GridComp.rc.

     Assuming the file gsi.rc.tmpl has a line like:
!  dfile      dtype dplat  dsis  dval dthin dsfcalc  obsclass
   prepbufr   t     null   t     1.0  0     0        ncep_prep_bufr
   
     the GSIsa program will match the obclass column in gsi.rc.tmpl
     with the obsclass provided in GSI_GridComp.rc and create the proper
     link between the actual file, say gdas1.20120319.t12z.prepbufr.ublk,
     and the GSI desired name, prepbufr.

    From this point on, there are only two files to edit when observing 
    systems as added or updated: gsi.rc.tmpl (gsi_sens.rc.tmpl) and obsys.rc.

    The special case related to when PREPQC is running is automatically
    handled by append_gsigcrc.pl, where a link is created to a prep-bufr
    file with an experiment name attached to it (a class called gmao_prep_bufr 
    is added to GSI_GridComp.rc and expected in gsi.rc.tmpl).

    NOTE: A technical point, most users shouldn't care for, is that
          the obsclass in gsi.rc.tmpl is GMAO's only. The parts of 
	  GSI that read OBS_INPUT table from the gsi.rc.tmpl file
	  only know about the first 7 columns; the obsclass column
	  is extra, and handled by the GMAO-specific file GSI_GridComp.F90.
	  In the future, if other columns are added to OBS_INPUT, the GMAO
	  column should always be placed at the end and GSI_GridComp adjusted
	  accordingly.

20Sep2013
---------

- Fixes to properly handle MLS Ozone observations (not only in GSI but also
  fvsetup(silo.arc);  and ODS)

- merge with ncep-gsi-r31500 (also add Kris/Jing changes to ozone)

- GSI minimization now using BiCG with orthogonalization of gradients for the
  forward DAS; backward DAS still uses sqrt(B) precond with orthogonalization

- update bufr lib to BUFRLIB_v10-2-3

07Sep2013
--------

- turn off chns 13 and 14 of HIRS3 and HIRS4 (Joa>Job, consistently)

02Aug2013
--------

Preliminary merge with NCEP r30303 (local tag: ncep-gsi-r30303)

o update to CRTM-2.1.3 (analysis pointing to temporary location of Coeffs)
o important to average user:
    - satinfo has now extra column for second-level qc (all set to 1 for now,
    which means do nothing)
    - scaninfo file includes more recent instruments 
    - both satbias and satbang restarts need to have airs281SUBSET_aqua
    replaced with airs281_aqua (mind the spaces)

This merge is preliminary for the following reasons:

- need to make sure SSMI/S modifications from NCEP and GMAO are correctly merged
- need to make sure aircraft bias correction has been integrated properly
- NCEP changes in read_ozone have largely been bypassed - need close look
- aerosol and chem-constituents capability incorporated as from NCEP, which means 
  code does not work for GMAO purposes: crtm_interface needs revision
- SSU change in crtm_interface needs revision (Meta had a change that seems to
  conflict with NCEP's)
- hybrid knob has not been tested for GMAO purposes (merged code also not yet
  tested for NCEP's dual resolution case)
- NCEPgsi_Coupler: needs proper update; a couple of routines dependent on 
                   grid2sub and sub2grid have been masked so code compiles;
		   that is, NCEP-4dvar knob will not work in this perlim version

  Relevant tags:
    Standalone NCEP-mode (gsi.x):
       - GSIsa_m0-ncep-r30303  - essentially, this is original NCEP r30303
         with minor changes to work for GMAO 
       - GSIsa_m0-gmao-r30303  - merged code (starting GMAO tag:
         GSIsa_m3-pert-22Jul2013 which is the version of GSI in
	 EnADAS-5_11_0_p7)
    Standalone GMAO-mode (GSIsa.x):
       GSIsa_m3-pert-r30303

  It is important to notice that the versions related to this merge are not
  yet fully consistent w/ the changes from 18Jun2013 and earlier - a full
  merge is yet to be completed.

18Jun2013
---------
- Changes to obs-impact related features:
   o now asm.acq controls asm.eta location (typically required by obs impact calc)
   o env var FCSTVERIFY defaults to asm but can be used to have obs-imp calculation
   done wrt ana.eta by setting it to ana and placing ana.acq in run dir

- Analysis now uses climatological CO2 to influence RTM calculations. 
  This requires the background file named cbkg.eta; this is now the default
  mode of running GSI. 
  To de-activate this feature do as follows:
    a) comment out table chem_guess in anavinfo file 
    b)

- Add NOAA-15 GOES, per Meta and Steve B. (and NCEP)

23Jun2013
---------

- knob to allow sensitivity on increment to be calculated.
  Instructions for how to use this feature:
    Say, sensitivity on increment at 20130115_00z is to be calculated
    a) touch a file named
           standalone.20130115_00z+20130115_00z-20130115_00z
       under the FVHOME/asens directory
    b) as with regular analysis sensitivity runs, this calculation uses 
       gsi_sens.rc.tmpl as driver of adjoint-GSI
    note: output ODS files will show up under Y2013/M01/D15/H00 with name
          type imp1_inc
    c) if user wants to apply an initadj-like norm to the increment:
       copy an existing initadj.rc to $FVHOME/asens/initadj4inc.rc and
       edit at will
    d) look in fvpsas.rc to properly set reference_eta_filename and
    verifcation_eta_filename entries
    e) make sure ana.acq brings in your reference and verification states
