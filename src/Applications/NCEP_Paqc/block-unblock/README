22 May 2009 - replace block.f , unblock.f, cnvt.c with new routine
              block_09.F - based on NCEP 'cwordsh' script/program
Source code is for both 'block' and 'unblock' routine, choice of
action is made through define -DUNBLOCK for 'unblock' routine.
The new 'cwordsh' requires linking to current NCEP BUFRLIB.  
This new version of 'block' will skip over extraneous data in the
input files such as bulletin headers - and even Fortran control
words so that files already 'block'ed can be 'block'ed again.

5 May 2005 - Seg fault on Palm/Altix showed a need to add error
    checking to the C routine which reads in the BUFR messages 
    for 'block'.  (For 'unblock' error checking can be done in
    Fortran routine used to read the data.)

28 Nov 2003 - Add some error checking to 'block', 'unblock' to
  exit with an error message if the BUFR message was bigger than
  the size of the buffer array 'mbay'.  Increased buffer size. 

25 Oct 2002 - Added Baoyu's 'reblock.c' program for converting
    big-endian blocked files to little-endian

Usage: reblock blockedfile(big endian) reblockedfile(little endian)

19 Sep 2002 - Adaptation for 'molotov' DEC Alpha - Sienkiewicz

I discovered a problem in our "cnvt.c" routine - it was finding
the sizeof(bufr) where 'bufr' is a pointer.  What is needed is
sizeof(*bufr), the object that 'bufr' was pointing to (integer).
When the sizeof(pointer) != sizeof(integer) this fails.
