README for oiqc

This is the 'oiqc' program from NCEP, used to perform quality
control on observation data.  It works when compiled with
MPI but will need more work for the OpenMP (revise one
IBM specific directive, I believe).

The code is more-or-less as-is from NCEP.

A routine vscos.f has been added to substitute for the IBM 
vector cosine routine.

Updated source for oiqcbufr.f with recent NCEP release

26 Jan 2006

New script "ssprepqc" replaces OIQC only "ssoiqc".  Script also includes
execution of 'fv2ss.x' as an interim solution until we can replace
'ssprevents.x'

1 July 2008

New script "gmao_prepqc" replaces "ssprepqc" - we can now read the
g5-eta files directly into the 'prevents' routine and so can eliminate
'fv2ss' step
