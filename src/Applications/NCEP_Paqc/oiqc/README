README for oiqc

8 July 2004                                          Meta Sienkiewicz

This is the 'oiqc' program from NCEP, used to perform quality
control on observation data.  It works when compiled with
MPI but will need more work for the OpenMP (revise one
IBM specific directive, I believe).

The code is more-or-less as-is from NCEP.

A routine vscos.f has been added to substitute for the IBM 
vector cosine routine.

19 Jan 2006

Updated source for oiqcbufr.f with recent NCEP release

26 Jan 2006

New script "ssprepqc" replaces OIQC only "ssoiqc".  Script also includes
execution of 'fv2ss.x' as an interim solution until we can replace
'ssprevents.x'

1 July 2008

New script "gmao_prepqc" replaces "ssprepqc" - we can now read the
g5-eta files directly into the 'prevents' routine and so can eliminate
'fv2ss' step


2 Sep 2008
Merged in modifications from NCEP to increase array sizes - allows handling
additional observations.  Also includes J. Woollen fix to NDDSPLIT for load
balancing error.

31 Jan 2012 

Modify to use 'new' quality mark QMN instead of original mark QM, when writing
SSM/I wind speed data record.  This will allow quality marks assigned by OIQC
to SSM/I windspeeds to be recorded in the output file.

24 Sep 2013

Merge in changes for WCOSS (except subroutine PREPQM).  Code now is
strictly MPI for simpler and better load balancing.  New WCOSS code had
problem in PREPQM where events on last ob were not written so is not (yet)
updated.

19 May 2017

Add call to 'maxout' to increase maximum BUFR record size for output.
Some raobs were being discarded from CQC/RADCOR because of overlarge
BUFR record sizes.

2 Jan 2018

Bump up array limits to accomodate increasing numbers of obs
MAXREP 900K to 1500K, MAXLEV 1100K to 2200K

5 Feb 2019

Added a change to allow calculation of forecast errors for wind observations
above 1 mb.  (Will set the pressure level used to 1 mb.)

20 Jan 2021

Modificatons to use 10-digit date from BUFR library instead of 8-digit default

26 May 2017

New version of gmao_prepqc to run new NRL QC instead of old acqc and acarsqc.
